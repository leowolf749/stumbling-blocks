# stumbling-blocks

Over the holiday break I worked on 'shoppers delight' and 'autocompletion'.

1. shoppers delight:

        A problem I ran into while I was building my site was getting the price information for 
        the items in the cart to calculate the subtotal, tax, and total of the cart.
        I did get the cart to append the name and price of the items when the add to cart
        button was clicked, but my trouble came when I needed to use that information for the
        next step. I realized I was only appending the cart items in the DOM but not actually
        storing them anywhere new with my javascript. I ended up rearranging a lot of my javascript 
        to fix the problem but I wasn't able to do that until we went through the problem in class.

2. autocompletion:

        This assignment came a bit easier to me and my site was functional by the specific requirements
        but I used a different method than I believe was expected. Instead of using javascript I used a 
        datalist in my html to store the options in the dropdown menu. Everything worked how it was 
        supposed to but I felt weird not using JS to do it because I feel like we were supposed to. I also
        wanted to get rid of the arrow on my dropdown and replace it with something else but could not find
        any understandable or useful information when I searched for how to do that. I tried a couple of
        things (I don't remember specifically what) but could not get them to work.
